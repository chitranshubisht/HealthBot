**Description**: 
Over the past year, the pandemic fundamentally changed several industries and impacted the means of consumption and distribution for goods and services globally. With the introduction of social distancing, the decline of indoor interactions and transactions, and unparalleled strain on hospital capacity and care teams, both retailers and health providers had to transform traditional business models to meet evolving consumer and industry needs. Across these industries, COVID-19 highlighted a greater need to support frontline workers and reach underserved communities. As a result, it’s become increasingly clear that consumers today need convenient, cost-effective, and high-quality goods and services to support everyday health and wellness. To meet the needs of consumers and expand equitable access to care, we’re supporting the ongoing development of an industry convergence known as Retail+Health with our cloud capabilities designed specifically for retailers and healthcare organizations.

The Azure Health Bot service empowers healthcare organizations to build and deploy an AI-powered, compliant, conversational healthcare experience at scale. The service combines built-in medical intelligence with natural language capabilities, extensibility tools and compliance constructs, allowing healthcare organizations such as Providers, Payers, Pharma, HMOs, Telehealth to give people access to trusted and relevant healthcare services and information.
